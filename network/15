# To make the intra.42.fr address reroute to 46.19.122.85 we need to modify /etc/hosts
# Assign the ip 46.19.122.85 to intra.42.fr
# After modifications your host file should look something like this:

# cat /etc/hosts

# 127.0.0.1       localhost
# 255.255.255.255 broadcasthost
# ::1             localhost
# 45.19.122.85	  intra.42.fr
